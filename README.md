# Eidolon Repraised

Work in progress fork-port of Eidolon to 1.19.2 and 1.20, trying to give a final wrap to unfinished content made by Elucent in the unfinished 1.18 branch.

Disclaimer

This mod original author is Elucent and all the assets as of 0.3.x versions are made by him. Most of the content made between the old 1.16 mod and this port was left unfinished after he lost interest in Minecraft. Many things might appear part of a much greater scheme because they were, but the goal of this port is not to follow the original plans nor to expand further.

This is also because i can't add significant stuff on my own without breaking the game and art style, so i'll limit myself to wrap up what was half-done to try keep it fun to play like the 1.16 version.

Feel free to reach out if you want to make an addon for this version of Eidolon, but wrapping up the wip stuff take priority on api support and datapack stuff.

<p>Quick resume of added content with 0.3.0 :</p>
<ul>
<li>Silver Armor &amp; tools, in addition to previous lead oregen.</li>
<li>Rituals to recharge your wands.</li>
<li>Ravens and Slugs. Tame a raven with beetroot seeds, breed slugs with pumpkin seeds. Raven can shed feathers.</li>
<li>Ethereal Hearts &amp; equips: The soulbone amulet and bonelord armor gives additional max health when an enemy is killed. The armor set is currently not craftable, but both are functional.</li>
<li>Archangel Sight Ring - Never miss a target again with this ring that will guide your arrows.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Raven Cloak - A cloak that becomes a majestic pair of wings to allow you to jump multiple times, glide or slowfall.</li>
<li>Summoning Staff - Use with the capturing ritual or the thrall spell to subdue undeads to your control and summon them when needed to help you.</li>
<li>Necromancer - Currently a raid boss that will summon undeads and shoot magic projectiles, will appear in the final waves to drop the summoning staff</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Main changes exclusive to this port :</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Recipes in the codex will be synced to the actual recipe as long as the recipe type is the same, instead of being hardcoded. Patchouli-like support for recipe type changes is planned atm.</li>
<li>Crucible and Worktable recipes are datapackable. Crucible can be heated by any block in the eidolon:crucible_hot_blocks tag, all campfire-like blocks are also compatible by default.</li>
<li>Dyed Warlock Armors, another little tweak from hexblades. No vanilla nor custom trimming is planned at the moment.
<ul>
<li>Rituals are datapackable too, change the recipe of any existing ritual and add new one for crafting, summoning or using a new ritual that can execute an arbitrary command.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As continue of Elu's old stuff:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Upgraded chant visuals. They were planned to become a way more complex spellcasting puzzle, but i've simplified them to a basic spell system to keep prayers important after the symbol for crafting has been obtained. Mana for spells is restored by praying or offering.</li>
<li>Research System: Planned as main component of the new progression, now it will be just a way to discover two spells using the known signs. Still WIP.</li>
<li>Holy Path: Alternative to the dark lord, currently not exclusive, but still WIP as it lacks themed items.&nbsp;<br />
<ul>
<li>New plants and decoblocks, mainly cosmetic as their planned use was lost. Plants might be used to make different kinds of incense but plans still have to be drafted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
